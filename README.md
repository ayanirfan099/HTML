# 🗂️ Random HTML Projects

This repository contains a collection of basic HTML projects and mini-experiments I created during my Computer Science degree. These projects were done to practice web development fundamentals like HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder in this repo represents a standalone project. Some are simple HTML pages, while others include CSS and JavaScript to enhance styling and interactivity.

Example projects might include:
- `portfolio-site/` – A simple personal portfolio template
- `calculator/` – A basic calculator using HTML, CSS & JavaScript
- `form-validation/` – A form with basic validation features
- `responsive-layout/` – A layout demo using media queries
- `color-picker/` – A basic tool to pick and apply background colors

> Feel free to explore each folder to see the code and run the pages in your browser!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Basic usage in some projects)
- No frameworks or libraries were used unless specified in the individual folders.

## 📚 Purpose

These projects were primarily built for:
- Learning and reinforcing web development concepts
- Completing university assignments
- Personal experimentation and fun

## 📌 Note

This repo was created to compile all the projects I did that helped me better understand HTML, CSS and JS coding. They are in no way or shape final projects.
